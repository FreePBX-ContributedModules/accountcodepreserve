"This module preservers the first callee's account code, that has an "
"accountcode, that it encounters. This preserved accoutcode will be used to "
"set the CDR(accountcode) for any outbound calls that result from any type of "
"redirected call (CF, VmX, Follow-Me, etc.). The account code for each user "
"is pulled out of their associated device settings, which means this is only "
"supported in extension mode and would have to be updated for deviceanduser "
"mode, requiring a new accountcode field to be defined for the user on the "
"extension/user screen."
